# E-Commerce-Web-Application

This is my final project for INFSCI 1059, Web Programming. My project is a web application for a small bakery named Cupcakery. 	

Though the project description did not require extensive styling or responsivity, I tried to make the web application as neat and user-friendly as possible with some responsive elements. **However, it is not 100% responsive, as the web application only needed to be viewable on a Google Chrome desktop browser**.

The first service is a customer-facing website that includes a menu and the ability to purchase individual cupcakes. The second service is an administrator dashboard that displays information on the orders in progress and the completed orders. In addition, the administrator can update an order's status. 

This project was a beast to tackle. The most challenging part was making sure that all of the individual pieces were working together as expected. For example, it took a lot of effort to ensure that the order items were properly updated in both the cart and the UI. Also, the project had a lot of tedious aspects, like the backend for the checkout form.
