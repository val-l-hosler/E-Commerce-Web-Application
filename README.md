# E-Commerce-Web-Application

This is my final project for INFSCI 1059, Web Programming. My project is a web application for a small bakery named Cupcakery. 	

The application is not 100% responsive, as it only needed to be viewable on a desktop browser. However, while responsivity was not a requirement for the project, I tried to add some into the design/development.

The first service is a customer-facing website that includes a menu and the ability to purchase individual cupcakes. The second service is an administrator dashboard that displays information on the orders in progress and the completed orders. In addition, the administrator can update an order's status. 

This project was a beast to tackle. The most challenging part was making sure that all of the individual pieces were working together as expected. For example, it took a lot of effort to ensure that the order items were properly updated in both the cart and the UI. Also, the project had a lot of tedious aspects, like the backend for the checkout form.
